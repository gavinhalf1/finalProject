final  project  rosen

here is my final project. I am a bit dissapointed as too the amount I got done, but I definitely learned a lot, thats for sure

I think i was a bit in over my head when i started with godot, but i learned stuff through  youtube which helped a lot

for me it was hard to stay organized  which made it difficult to keep track of things and make sure they all work together
